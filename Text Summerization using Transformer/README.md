This repo is the used to make a model on sentiment summerizer. This tool utilizes the HuggingFace Pytorch transformers library to run extractive summarizations. This works by first embedding the sentences, then classify its starting and text to get the summerize output.The advantage of using this repo is computation time,due to its smart batching technique its create a great differnce in compuration time and performnce also.
